The resulting data fields tidy.txt are summarized in 5 steps by the script run_analysis.R.
* 1 Download the datasets.
* 2 Loads both datasets and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* 3 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* 5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
