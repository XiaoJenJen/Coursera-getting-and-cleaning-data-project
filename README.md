# Project - Getting and Cleaning Data
  This repository includes the R code and documentation files. The dataset is 
  wearable computing-data collected from accelerometers from Samsung Galaxy S 
  smartphone. 
  
## The resulting data fields tidy.txt are summarized in 5 steps by the script `run_analysis.R`.
* 1 Download the datasets.
* 2 Loads both datasets and extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* 3 Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* 3 Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
* 4 Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
* 5 From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set 
with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.  

## Listed Files
* 1 `README.md` shows the overview of this repository.
* 2 `CodeBook.md` describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or 
  work that was performed to clean up the data.
* 3 `run_analysis.R` is the R script performing the required analyses for this 
  project.
* 4 `TidyDataset.txt` is the endresult.
